1. Obviously unzip the archive, duuh :D 
2. Run MapWriter.java
3. The previous step should have generated a generatedMap.map file, I am pretty sure there is some faulty logic in the algorithm as it doesn't always place the GuardsSpawningArea.
4. Run GUI.java just like the the good old times, if it doesn't run, then run MapWriter again and then GUI.java and it should run this time.
