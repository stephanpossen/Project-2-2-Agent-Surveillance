/**
 * Represents the percepts of an agent.
 *
 * Percept: A perceived object as it exists in the mind of someone perceiving it;
 *          the mental impression that is the result of perceiving something.
 *
 * All precepts are relative to the agent.
 * This means that each agent has effectively it's own coordinate system.
 * The agent is always located in the point (0, 0) of that coordinate system.
 * The direction the agent is facing coincides with the positive part of y-axis in the agent coordinate system.
 * All direction percepts (angles) are relative to the y-axis, and angles grow clockwise.
 *
 * You should also take a look at:
 * @see Percept.Vision.FieldOfView
 * @see Utils.Utils#clockAngle
